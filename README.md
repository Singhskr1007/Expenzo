                  create server.js (or app.js or index.js)
                  
                  In package.json :
                  Rename "main" as "server.js"
                  
                        In "scripts" :
      
                              "start": "node server.js"
                              "dev": "nodemon server.js"
                  
                  Install Nodemon : 
                        npm i nodemon --save-dev
                  
            
            🔹 Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

                  npm create vite@latest
                  npm install


🔧 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the backend folder with the following:
            
            PORT=8000
            MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
            JWT_SECRET = Create a random 64 bits hashed value using command, node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
            Replace your_mongodb_connection_string with your actual MongoDB connection.
            

▶️ 4. Run the Application
      Start the Backend Server (with Nodemon):
      cd backend
      npm run dev  (or nodemon)
      Make sure your package.json in backend has this script:
      
      
      cd ../frontend
      npm run dev
